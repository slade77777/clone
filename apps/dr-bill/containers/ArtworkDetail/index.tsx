              Oblique Cube Composition is a generative art "derivative" piece inspired by an OP Art painting (acrylic
              and panel) done by Victor Vasarely, called Hommage a l`Hexagon. c.1968. While Vasarely passed before the
              advent of Computer Art his works have always intellectually challenged me as a generative artist to derive
              an algorithm to produce similar aesthetic affects.

              An oblique cube is a form of axonometric (parallel) projection where the front face is full size and shape
              (height and width), perpendicular to the viewer and the depth is drawn full size along receding lines
              usually a 45 degree angle.

              In this composition an array of squares are generated. Within each square oblique cubes are drawn in
              pieces from back to front, in a random orientation, in random colors. All the cube faces are the same
              random color. A random number "coin flip" algorithm determines whether or not a diamond shape is drawn on
              the front face of the cube. All the diamond shapes on the cube faces are the same random color.

              What makes this image interesting to me is the way the faces of contiguous cubes combine and how the areas
              of the square that the cube does not cover (the black background) integrate into the piece and provide
              structure producing a visual "whole greater than the sum of its parts."
