        Hedgies with very special attributes on Ethereum blockchain will be
        minted using our original smart contract from 2018.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Gen 1 and Gen 2 Hedgie holders will claim one OG Hedgie (Gen 3) for
          each Hedgie they hold
        </li>
        <li>300 are reserved for giveaways, promotions and team</li>
        <li>The rest will be distributed via a public sale</li>
        <li>This edition will complete the Hedgie collection at 10K</li>
        <li>There will never be any more Hedgies minted, ever</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each OG Hedgie is unique, programmatically generated using about 100 different
        attributes. Among these will be very special artist collab editions
        that will be auctioned on OpenSea, and kick off the Hedgie Art Club.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purchase price is 0.08 ETH. The Hedgies are randomly assigned to
        your wallet. You never know which one youâ€™re going to get! You can
        purchase a maximum of 10 Hedgies in one transaction.
